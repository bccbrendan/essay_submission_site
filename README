This is a basic webserver to let students
practice typing essays and submit them via email
to their teachers.

To set up this webserver on your account, you'll need to change the following:
* In 'bottle_app.py' replace
    - python_anywhere_user = <your python_anywhere username.'
    - teacher_gmail = 'email address where submissions end up'
